If you apply for a job, internship, or business relationship with Nebusis®, we collect application materials, background information, and interview notes solely for evaluation, hiring, or collaboration purposes.

6. Hosting and Cloud Infrastructure Security
Nebusis® does not operate its own data centers. Instead, we rely on trusted third-party cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting. These providers ensure:

Encryption of data in transit and at rest

Physical and digital access control

Redundancy and availability monitoring

Independent certification to international security standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001)

All data is logically separated, and administrative access is tightly restricted.

With client authorization or using de-identified data, Nebusis® may analyze system usage to train AI models, enhance rule engines, and improve products like Nebusis® ComplianceOne, Nebusis® Engage, and Nebusis® CyberWatch.

No identifiable information is ever used for machine learning without explicit permission.

8. Industry-Specific Privacy Controls
Nebusis® solutions support regulated environments. For clients in healthcare, finance, government, or defense, we apply additional privacy safeguards aligned with:

HIPAA

ISO/IEC 27001

ISO 42001

GDPR

Local regulatory requirements

Custom configurations are available to meet your organization’s compliance mandates.

9. Public Website and Portal Interactions
When using our website or demo portals, we may collect limited information (e.g., page visits, device info, form submissions) for security and analytics purposes. This data is not shared or sold.

10. Platform Monitoring and Performance
All Nebusis® apps are continuously monitored to:

Detect errors or outages

Ensure service availability

Identify usage trends

Prevent misuse or unauthorized access

Monitoring is non-invasive and excludes any user profiling.

11. Global Data Transfers
Your data may be stored or processed outside your country. Wherever it resides, Nebusis® enforces consistent privacy protections, using appropriate mechanisms such as:

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)

Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)

Vendor audits and risk assessments

12. Automated Decision-Making and AI Use
Some Nebusis® features use algorithms to analyze data and offer recommendations (e.g., audit scoring, risk indicators). However, no automated decision leads to legal or contractual outcomes without human review.

13. Third-Party Services and Integrations
Nebusis® apps may connect to third-party tools (e.g., eSignature platforms, payment processors). We ensure all vendors follow strict privacy and security protocols, and we disclose integrations clearly when they impact your data.

14. Confidentiality and ISO Framework Alignment
