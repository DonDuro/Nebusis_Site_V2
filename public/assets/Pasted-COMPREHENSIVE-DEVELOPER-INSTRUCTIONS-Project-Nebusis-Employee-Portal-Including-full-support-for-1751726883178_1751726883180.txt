COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS
📌 Project: Nebusis® Employee Portal
Including full support for contractual staff assignments to external organizations (QSI entities and other clients)

🧩 1. KEY NEW REQUIREMENT
Some Nebusis® employees, consultants, or project-based personnel are assigned to client organizations on a contract basis — particularly:

QSI Academy

QSI Auditing and Certification Services, LLC

Other companies within the QSI Global Ventures ecosystem

Third-party clients receiving managed services or technical leadership

The portal must:

Track assignment roles and duration

Provide access to project/client-specific tools, SOPs, and documents

Support separate reporting lines and KPIs for assigned roles

Maintain compliance with Nebusis®’ own QMS, even while assigned externally

🔧 2. ROUTE, STACK, AND INTEGRATION (UNCHANGED)
Route: /employee

Reuse existing architecture and UI components

Add Assignment Management Layer to portal logic

👥 3. USER ROLE ENHANCEMENT
Role	Description
assigned_contractor	Employee or contractor assigned to a client organization or QSI subsidiary
assignment_supervisor	Manager from client company (e.g., QSI Academy director) who can view deliverables and approve reports
dual_manager	Nebusis® executive overseeing staff performance while deployed

Staff can simultaneously have:

A Nebusis® internal role (e.g., employee_staff)

An assigned client role (e.g., QSI Academy Coordinator)

📦 4. NEW MODULE: “Client Assignment Center”
This new section must appear in the Employee Portal for any user flagged as assigned_contractor.

Features:
View current and past assignments

Client name

Assignment title/role

Start and end dates

Assigned supervisor

View assignment-specific documents

Job descriptions

SOPs

Checklists

Onboarding and offboarding materials

Upload deliverables

Submit timesheets (if assignment requires)

Request role clarification or assignment extension

📈 5. PERFORMANCE & KPI MANAGEMENT (CLIENT-SPECIFIC)
Client-based KPIs must be tracked separately from internal KPIs:

Tracked via Nebusis® PerformanceTracker

Linked to assignment-specific outcomes and goals

Supervisors (from QSI Academy, QSI Auditing, etc.) can:

Approve task completion

Submit performance feedback

Flag concerns or training needs

🧾 6. TIME & FINANCIAL REPORTING
Timesheets must distinguish:

Internal hours (Nebusis® operations)

External assignment hours (client delivery)

For finance roles:

Billable work tied to Nebusis® SmartBooks® for invoicing clients

Include cost center assignment and project code

📂 7. ASSIGNMENT-SPECIFIC TOOL ACCESS
Users assigned to external roles may need restricted access to client resources:

Tool	Conditional Access
Nebusis® Docs	Project-specific shared folders with client SOPs
Nebusis® KnowledgeCheck®	Client-mandated training (QSI training modules)
Nebusis® LegalFlow	Assignment contracts and NDAs
Nebusis® ComplianceCore®	Audit protocols for assignments governed by ISO or QMS policies

Client-specific folders or resources should be assigned dynamically per assignment profile.

📬 8. CLIENT COMMUNICATION BRIDGE
Enable structured communication with client supervisors:

Message inbox or Q&A thread

Upload status reports or timesheets

Receive assignment updates and calendar events

🛡️ 9. COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT
All assignments must:

Respect Nebusis®’ Quality Management System

Follow client-specific compliance rules, if applicable

Be audit-ready via Nebusis® ComplianceCore®

QMS officers must be able to:

View assignment-specific risks and controls

Track deliverables and completion dates

Ensure continuous QMS alignment
