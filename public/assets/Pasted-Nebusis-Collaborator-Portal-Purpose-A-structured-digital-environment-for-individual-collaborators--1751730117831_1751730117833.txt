✅ IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE
“The Nebusis® Collaborator Portal must be immediately restructured to reflect a role-based architecture. Each collaborator’s profile must clearly define their current role, standard compensation, active and historical assignments, any adjusted compensation tied to specific assignments, and all tools/applications needed to execute those assignments. This structure must support integration with the broader Nebusis® Business Suite and align with contractual service delivery to internal and external organizations, especially those within QSI Global Ventures.”
