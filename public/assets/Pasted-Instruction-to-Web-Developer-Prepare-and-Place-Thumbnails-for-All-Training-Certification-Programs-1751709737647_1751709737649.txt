Instruction to Web Developer: Prepare and Place Thumbnails for All Training & Certification Programs
Please prepare and place custom thumbnail images for the Certified Prompt Engineering Specialist (CPES) program, as well as for all current and future training and certification programs offered through Nebusis Cloud Services, LLC and QSI Academy.

✅ Task Overview:
You are responsible for both:

Designing and preparing the thumbnails, and

Integrating and displaying them appropriately throughout the website.

🎯 Requirements for Thumbnails
1. Purpose:
Thumbnails will be used on:

Training catalog pages

Program-specific landing pages

Homepage sections

Search results or listings

Related course recommendations

2. Design Specifications:
Dimensions: 600x400 pixels (preferred 16:9 ratio)

Format: WebP or optimized PNG

Size: Under 200KB per image

Naming: thumbnail-[program-name].webp (e.g., thumbnail-CPES.webp)

3. Visual Content Guidelines:
Each thumbnail must clearly represent the program’s theme:

CPES: Use visuals such as chat bubbles, AI interfaces, natural language code, or certificate icons

Others: Use appropriate symbols for each subject (e.g., shield for security, document for auditing, globe for sustainability)

May include short overlay text or acronym (e.g., “CPES”, “ISO 9001”)

Follow Nebusis® / QSI brand guidelines (color palette, font, style)
