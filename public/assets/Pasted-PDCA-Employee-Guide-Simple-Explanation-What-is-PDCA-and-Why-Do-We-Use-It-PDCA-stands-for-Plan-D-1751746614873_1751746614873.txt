PDCA Employee Guide - Simple Explanation
What is PDCA and Why Do We Use It?
PDCA stands for Plan-Do-Check-Act - it's a simple way to organize your work and make sure you're always improving. Think of it like a recipe for success that helps you plan your work, do it well, check if it worked, and then improve for next time.
